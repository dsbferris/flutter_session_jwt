# flutter_session_jwt

This package allows you to store the JWT token in secure storage and can decode the json web token. Since the payload is base64 encoded you can easily know the payload data stored with no password required, there are other methods available to get expiry date, issued date, and can check whether token expired or not.

This package can help you to store the JWT token in secure storage and provide you different methods to access information from the token.

> Note: Make sure to save the token before accessing other methods.

## Getting started

In your `pubspec.yaml` file within your Flutter Project:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_session_jwt: <latest_version>
```

## Usage

Import the package

```dart
import 'package:flutter_session_jwt/flutter_session_jwt.dart';
```

Here is an exmaple to store the JWT token post login

```dart
Future<http.Response> login(String userName , String password) async{
  var response = await http.post(
    Uri.parse('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums'),
    headers: <String, String>{
      'Content-Type': 'application/json; charset=UTF-8',
    },
    body: jsonEncode(<String, String>{
      'userName': userName,
      'password': password
    }),
  );

  if(response.statusCode == 200){
    var token = response.body.token;
    await FlutterSessionJwt.saveToken(token);
  }
}
```

Once token is saved, you can access the other methods as below.

- To get payload from JWT token

```dart
//This will return payload object/map
await FlutterSessionJwt.getPayload();
```

- To retrieve saved token

```dart
//This method will return saved token for further API calls
await FlutterSessionJwt.retrieveToken();
```

- To get expiration date and time

```dart
//Make sure pass `exp` key in the payload
//This method will return expiration ```DateTime```
await FlutterSessionJwt.getExpirationDateTime();
```

- To get issued date and time

```dart
//Make sure pass `iat` key in the payload
//This method will return issuedAt ```DateTime```
 await FlutterSessionJwt.getIssuedDateTime();
```

- To get whether token has expired or not

```dart
//This will return bool with true/false
//If token expired, it will return true else false
await FlutterSessionJwt.isTokenExpired();
```

- To get the time difference between issued time and current time

```dart
//This will return the token's age since issue
await FlutterSessionJwt.getDurationFromIssuedTime();
```

- To delete the token from storage

```dart
//This will delete the token
await FlutterSessionJwt.deleteToken();
```
